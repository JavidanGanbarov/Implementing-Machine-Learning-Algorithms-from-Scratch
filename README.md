## Metrics 📊

To evaluate the performance of the implemented machine learning algorithms, the following metrics are commonly used. Each algorithm includes basic evaluation functions for measuring its effectiveness:
1. Linear Regression Evaluation Metrics:

    Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values. It helps determine how well the model fits the data.

    R-squared (R²): Indicates how well the regression predictions approximate the real data points. The closer the R² value is to 1, the better the model fits the data.

## Usage 🛠️

1. Navigate to the directory of the desired algorithm:
   cd Linear Regression from Scratch/Linear2.py

2. Run the Python script to see the algorithm in action:
   python Linear2.py

3. Modify datasets or parameters in the script as needed.
